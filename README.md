# My DOTFILES

This my repo for sharing my configuration files.

## Quick Start

This script only work on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).

```console
$ ./install.sh
```

## Third-party requirements

You will need to install these packages to make some config files work properly:

### ArchLinux:

See [packages.txt](./packages.txt) and [packages.yay.txt](./packages.yay.txt).

### Ubuntu

See [packages.ubuntu.txt](./packages.ubuntu.txt).

### Github

- [boomer](https://github.com/tsoding/boomer)

# IMPORTANT

## Distro

These config should work just fine on any debian based or arch based linux distro.

## .bashrc-personal

In the function `changeBright` on .bashrc-personal you will need to change to your display "name", that you can get from `xrandr`.
