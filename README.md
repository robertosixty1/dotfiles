## Distro

These config files are used on my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) installation, i DON'T TEST THESE CONFIG FILES ON ANY OTHER DISTRO and i'm NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE caused on your WM Config.

In the function ´changeBright´ on .bashrc-personal you will need to change to your display "name", that you can get from ´xrandr´.
